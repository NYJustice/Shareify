In the singer's native Canada, the song peaked at number one. In the United States it also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, replacing his own \"Can't Feel My Face\". The song also made the top 10 in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. It reached the top 20 in Denmark and Sweden while reaching the top 40 in The Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. A music video for the song was released on May 27, 2015. It was directed by Grant Singer. Two official remixes of the song features rappers Eminem and Nicki Minaj.\n\nThe song is written in the key of C minor in common time with a tempo of 113 beats per minute. The vocals in the song span from C4 to E♭6.\n\nProducer Illangelo stated ”I’m very optimistic and positive with anything I put my energy towards, so for me, Abel’s success now is what I imagined it always should have been. ‘The Hills’ was an opportunity for us to go back to the classical, original the Weeknd moments of our first mixtapes that I co–produced and mixed in their entirety, and then bringing that into a new context, with a pop arrangement and chords in a faster tempo. It’s the perfect marriage of that.\"\n\nThe music video for \"The Hills\" was directed by Grant Singer. It was uploaded to YouTube on May 27, 2015. As of December 2016, the video has been viewed over 960 million times, having more views than any other music video by The Weeknd. The video begins showing a wrecked car that has flipped over, and it is unknown why the car has flipped over. The Weeknd is seen crawling out of the car before helping two women to get out. As the song progresses, Weeknd is seen walking by himself down a dark street in Los Angeles, and around the middle of the song, the wrecked car explodes behind him. He occasionally is pushed repeatedly by one of the women from the car. At the end of the song, he enters an abandoned mansion, and goes upstairs to a room illuminated with red light. A man holding an apple sits waiting for him, next to two other women, and the video cuts to black.\n\nThe man from inside the mansion is Rick Wilder also appears in both the \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"Tell Your Friends\" music videos.\n\nAnother music video was filmed for the Eminem remix in collaboration with GoPro and United Realities, is a 360-degree virtual reality video in which The Weeknd is seen leaving a venue and heading to his limo. As the viewer changes the angles, it's shown that comets are raining down and the raining debris causing fiery explosions around the area. As he approaches his limousine, a fiery explosion consumes him."

          "strDescriptionEN": "\"Starboy\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer The Weeknd for his third studio album of the same name. It features French electronic duo Daft Punk and was written by the trio alongside Doc McKinney, Henry Walter and Jason Quenneville, being produced by Daft Punk and co-produced by The Weeknd, McKinney and Cirkut. It was released as the first single from the album on September 22, 2016, by XO and Republic Records. It is an R&B song with lyrics that contain themes of extravagance of a celebrity life.\n\n\"Starboy\" topped the charts in countries such as Canada, France, Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden, as well as the US Billboard Hot 100, where it became The Weeknd's third chart-topper, and Daft Punk's first chart-topper. The music video for the song was directed by frequent collaborator Grant Singer, who directed The Weeknd's previous music videos for \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\". In the music video, The Weeknd is shown trying to destroy evidence of his previous self, including his own awards from his past album, Beauty Behind the Madness. The video has been described as The Weeknd's attempt to murder his former persona.\n\n\"Starboy\" was released on September 22, 2016, following the announcement of the album and its accompanying artwork a day earlier. \"Starboy\" is an R&B song that incorporates themes of the extravagance associated with a celebrity lifestyle and also discusses how the celebrity lifestyle can make an entertainer fragile.\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by frequent collaborator Grant Singer, who directed The Weeknd's previous music videos for \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\". It was released through the singer's official Vevo account on September 28, 2016 on YouTube, along with an accompanying poster which Rolling Stone described as \"pulp-horror-inspired\". The video has been described as the singer's attempt to kill his former/old persona, perhaps signaling he is reinventing himself with this new album, by suffocating himself, clipping his old hairstyle, and crushing his glass-framed platinum records.\n\nSeveral cars owned by The Weeknd are mentioned in the song's lyrics and featured in the video, including the Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster which he sings in his second verse: \"Pull off in that Roadster SV/ Pockets overweight, getting hefty,\" a Bentley Mulsanne: \"No competition, I don't really listen/ I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition,\" and the McLaren P1: \"I'm trying to put you in the worst mood/ P1 cleaner than your church shoes.\" Billboard approached John Paolo Canton, McLaren Automotive's director of public relations, in order to find out the owner of the car, as their website stated \" even the world's biggest carmaker  afford product placement like this, let alone a boutique British brand\". Canton later confirmed that the car did belong to The Weeknd."

          "strDescriptionEN": "\"Take My Breath\" is a song by Canadian singer the Weeknd. It was released on August 6, 2021, as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album. It was universally acclaimed for its nostalgic '80s beats and synths. A portion of the song's instrumental was first teased by the Weeknd on social media platforms on August 2, 2021.\n\nBackground and promotion\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in September 2020, via an interview with Rolling Stone in which he stated \"I might have another album ready to go by the time this quarantine is over\". Later on during the 2021 Billboard Music Awards in May, he went on to state in his acceptance speech \"I just want to say the After Hours are done and The Dawn is coming.\" The Weeknd continued mentioning the upcoming project under the working name \"The Dawn\" on social media, throughout June and July, with him revealing a new style for his next chapter and dropping the collaborations \"You Right\" and \"Better Believe\", respective collaborations with Doja Cat, and Belly and Young Thug, during that period to showcase it in the visuals for the two tracks.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, a snippet of \"Take My Breath\" with a visual of a sunrise titled \"The Dawn Is Coming\" and a GQ interview was released in promotion of the track, with the single's release date of August 6, 2021 being confirmed through the release of a Tokyo Olympics 2020 promotional video later that day.\n\nCritical reception\n“Take My Breath” received universal acclaim. The vocals and production of the track received praise from Billboard's Joe Lynch, who compared the latter aspect's usage of a synthesizer to the synth riff that was used in Donna Summer's 1977 single \"I Feel Love\". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian gave the song a five-star rating, stating that it is \"an instant disco-pop masterpiece\".\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Take My Breath\" was first teased by the Weeknd on social media via self-released images of the visual during the week leading up to the release of the single. It originally was supposed to play before IMAX showings of The Suicide Squad, but was reportedly pulled due to epilepsy concerns in regards to the \"intense strobe lighting\" featured in the clip. The video was released alongside the song."
